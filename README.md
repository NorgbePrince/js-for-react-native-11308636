# Array Manipulation and User Profile Creation

## Student ID: [11308636]

### Task 1: Array Manipulation
This task involves creating a function `processArray` that takes an array of numbers and returns a new array where each even number is squared and each odd number is tripled.

### Task 2: Array String Manipulation
This task involves creating a function `formatArrayStrings` that takes two arrays as arguments: an array of strings and an array of numbers processed by `processArray`. The function modifies each string based on its corresponding number: capitalizing the entire string if the number is even, and converting the string to lowercase if the number is odd.

### Task 3: User Profile Creation
This task involves creating a function `createUserProfiles` that takes an array of names and the array of modified names from Task 2. The function returns an array of objects, each containing `originalName`, `modifiedName`, and `id` (auto-incremented starting from 1).

### Code Organization
The code is organized into two files: `arrayManipulation.js` and `userInfo.js`. The `arrayManipulation.js` file contains the `processArray` and `formatArrayStrings` functions, while the `userInfo.js` file contains the `createUserProfiles` function.
